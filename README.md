This is basic project which is intended for site visitors who want 
to buy or take a rent of  playstation 4. New users can register on the site, or if they have account 
they can normally login. After that they can decide whether to buy or rent console. Information about user,
purchase, and rent are stored in different tables in MySQL database. Purchase scenario is same as on the 
other sites for sales technology or other merchandise, user choose which type of console will buy and after
that the purchase continues and is confirmed in the shopping cart. If they decide to rent console,they also
choose which console want, and on one click all informations are storing in table. Thinking of adding some new
features in future about rent scenarios in view of frontend design and backend logic.Technologies i used:
PHP,CSS,JavaScript,HTML, MySQL.
